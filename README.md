### What I learned

I've done quite a few JavaScript project now for beginners. It's still pretty hard for me though but I getting on quite well. I will continue to take on more project to polish  my JS skills. I have now progressed to taking on `Junior Level` JS projects and this is my first. It was easy and interesting to make.

### Continued development

I'm now in `Junior Level` in javascript. I will continue to forge ahead and complete more projects until I become confident in my Javascript abilities.
